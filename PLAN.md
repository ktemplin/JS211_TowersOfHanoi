# Code Plan

## Problem:
Update starter code to allow game to function properly, the logic for the game is simple and defined here: [Towers of Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi)
NOTE: Minimal # of moves to win in ToH is (2^n - 1), where n is the number of disks.


## Required Features:
- Win condition when all pieces moved from Bottom (or left) stack to Top (or right) - Logic to confirm correct alignment in correct column
- Larger pieces cannot be placed atop smaller pieces - Logic to stop this
- Optional:
    - Track number of moves player has made
        - Can I also compare this to optimal play? (2^n-1 moves)
    - Add sounds and visuals
    - Change columns from left aligned (top, middle, bottom) to centered (left, middle, right)
    - Make pieces more visually appealing 


## Planned Tasks:


## Time Requirements:
* Due 10/30, so I have **ONE** week to complete!
